# Image Classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) 
This project implements an image classifier using TensorFlow/Keras with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The classifier is trained to distinguish between "Happy" and "Sad" facial expressions from images.
## Project Structure
1. data/: Directory containing the dataset organized by classes ("Happy" and "Sad").
2. Remove dodgy images: Python script to remove non-image files from the dataset.
3. train_model.ipynb: Jupyter notebook demonstrating the entire pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation and prediction.
4. README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project, installation instructions, and usage guide.
5. requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies required to run the project.
